 *
 *  Specifically, this function will always return an object.  If an
 *  error occurs, then the "error" property of the return'd object
 *  will be set to a suitable error message.  If everything ok, then
 *  the "ppm" property of return'd object will be set to a Ppm image
 *  ppmOut which is derived from this.ppm with msg hidden.
 *
 *  The ppmOut image will be formed from the image contained in this
 *  StegModule object and msg as follows.
 *
 *    1.  The meta-info (header, comments, resolution, color-depth)
 *        for ppmOut is set to that of the PPM image contained in this
 *        StegModule object.
 *
 *    2.  A magicMsg is formed as the concatenation of STEG_MAGIC,
 *        msg and the NUL-character '\0'.
 *
 *    3.  The bits of the character codes of magicMsg including the
 *        terminating NUL-character are unpacked (MSB-first) into the
 *        LSB of successive pixel bytes of the ppmOut image.  Note
 *        that the pixel bytes of ppmOut should be identical to those
 *        of the image in this StegModule object except that the LSB of each
 *        pixel byte will contain the bits of magicMsg.
 *
 *  The function should detect the following errors:
 *
 *    STEG_TOO_BIG:   The provided pixelBytes array is not large enough 
 *                    to allow hiding magicMsg.
 *    STEG_MSG:       The image contained in this StegModule object may already
 *                    contain a hidden message; detected by seeing
 *                    this StegModule object's underlying image pixel bytes
 *                    starting with a hidden STEG_MAGIC string.
 *
 * Each error message must start with the above IDs (STEG_TOO_BIG, etc).

 *  return'd object should have a "msg" property set to the hidden
 *  message.  Note that the return'd message should not contain
 *  STEG_MAGIC or the terminating NUL '\0' character.
 *
 *  The function will detect the following errors:
 *
 *    STEG_NO_MSG:    The image contained in this Steg object does not
 *                    contain a hidden message; detected by not
 *                    seeing this Steg object's underlying image pixel
 *                    bytes starting with a hidden STEG_MAGIC
 *                    string.
 *    STEG_BAD_MSG:   A bad message was decoded (the NUL-terminator
 *                    was not found).
 *
 * Each error message must start with the above IDs (STEG_NO_MSG, etc).
